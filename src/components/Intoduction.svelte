			<p>
				I'm a passionate backend engineer with over {yearOfExperience} years of experience in software
				development. I've been deeply involved in crafting efficient and robust backend solutions for
				web development.
			</p>
			<p>
				In recent years, I've been working with a modern stack that includes TypeScript, Node.js,
				PHP, and Laravel. I find joy in leveraging the power of these technologies to build scalable
				and maintainable systems. Whether it's architecting APIs, implementing data processing
				pipelines, or fine-tuning database performance, I'm dedicated to delivering high-quality
				solutions that meet the needs of the ever-evolving digital landscape.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new backend paradigms, participating in tech
				communities, and continuously learning to stay ahead in this dynamic field. I'm excited
				about the possibilities that technology brings and always eager to take on new challenges.
